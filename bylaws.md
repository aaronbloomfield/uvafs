1. **[Name]{#I}**

	The name of this body shall be the Faculty Senate of the University of Virginia.

2. **[Purpose]{#II}**

	1. [The]{#II.A} Faculty Senate represents all faculties of the University of Virginia with respect to all academic functions such as the establishment and termination of degree programs, major modifications of requirements for existing degrees, and action affecting all faculties, or more than one faculty, of the University of Virginia.

	2. [Additionally,]{#II.B} the Faculty Senate shall advise the President and the Rector and Board of Visitors concerning educational and related matters affecting the welfare of the University of Virginia.

3. **[Eligibility]{#III}**

	Those persons shall be eligible for election to the Faculty Senate who have been appointed to a salaried faculty position at the University of Virginia at Charlottesville, except for those who are ex-officio members of the Faculty Senate, as enumerated below.

4. **[Membership]{#IV}**

	1. [Members]{#IV.A} of the Faculty who hold the following administrative positions shall be ex-officio members with voice and without vote, except in the case of a tie vote, where the President shall cast the deciding vote:

		2. [The]{#IV.A.ii} University of Virginia Vice-Presidents
		3. [The]{#IV.A.iii} Deans of the Schools of the University of Virginia

	2. [There]{#IV.B} shall be approximately eighty-two (82) elected members of the Faculty Senate, allocated among the constituent Faculties of the University of Virginia at Charlottesville in accordance with the following formulas: the Faculty of each School (except the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences) shall elect the number that is closest to the percentage of eighty-two (82) that is derived by taking the average of (a) the percentage of the total salaried faculty at the University of Virginia at Charlottesville who hold their primary appointment in that School, with those not in a School forming their own delegation as if it were a School, and (b) the percentage of the total number of full-time students at the University of Virginia at Charlottesville who are enrolled in that School. Any School whose allocation would yield less than two senators will have two senators; this will not change the allocation for the other Schools.

	3. [In]{#IV.C} computing the number of students, full-time graduate medical education trainees of the University of Virginia Medical Center shall be included with the number of students in the School of Medicine, and post-doctoral fellows in all Schools of the University of Virginia shall be counted as students in that School. The enrollment of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences shall be counted with that of the College of Arts and Sciences for purposes of this computation.

	4. [In]{#IV.D} computing the number of faculty on which representation is to be based, all faculty will be counted whether active or on leave. Their temporary replacements will not be counted. Individuals with multiple appointments will be counted only with their primary affiliation.

	5. [Reapportionment]{#IV.E} of seats on the Faculty Senate shall be accomplished annually.

5. **[Elections and Terms]{#V}**

	1. [Elected]{#V.A} members of the Faculty Senate shall serve for a term of four years, commencing on July 1 of the calendar year. Election procedures shall be determined by each of the constituent Faculties, except that

		1. [Whether]{#V.A.i} Senators are elected or appointed, procedures are subject to the approval of the Faculty Senate itself and must be on file with the Faculty Senate office. Changes in procedures are due February 1 of each year.
		2. [When]{#V.A.ii} a constituent Faculty is entitled to be represented by more than one elected or appointed member, terms shall be staggered to provide, insofar as practicable, continuity and consistency in the number of Senators to be elected.
		3. [The]{#V.A.iii} seat of an elected or appointed member shall be deemed vacant if the incumbent is absent from the University of Virginia and non-communicative with the Faculty Senate or its committees, for any cause, for more than one semester. In this event, a replacement shall be elected or appointed to fill out the whole of the unexpired portion of the member's term.
		4. [Election]{#V.A.iv} or appointment of Senators for each Faculty must be conducted so as to allow notification of results prior to Spring recess and no later than March 15 of each year.

6. **[Responsibilities of Faculty Senate Members]{#VI}**

	The Faculty Senate is a deliberative body which relies upon the collective experience and wisdom of its members.

		1. [Annually]{#VII.E.i} the Chair-Elect of the Faculty Senate, and a complement of faculty senators necessary to bring the existing “at large” officers to a total of seven, shall be placed in nomination no later than the last regular meeting of the Faculty Senate in the Spring and then elected using a mechanism implemented by the choice of the majority of the Faculty Senate
			1. [It]{#VII.E.i.a} shall generally be the practice of the Faculty Senate to vote on matters in person with the exception of elections and other matters explicitly discussed in the bylaws. Notwithstanding other sections of these bylaws, a vote may be taken online at the request of the movant, provided that the matter has been discussed at a meeting of the Faculty Senate prior to the online vote.
		2. [The]{#VII.E.ii} Chair of the Faculty Senate shall oversee the impaneling of a Nominating Committee to select candidates to run for election to Faculty Senate office (e.g. Chair, Executive Council, Board of Visitors, Parliamentarian) by October 15. The charge of the Nominating Committee is to solicit nominations, including self-nominations, to develop a slate of candidates including at least one nominee for Chair-Elect and a minimum of two nominees for each other position established by the Faculty Senate. Members of the Nominating Committee are ineligible to serve in any of the positions to be filled. The Committee shall have five members:
			1. [The]{#VII.E.ii.a} immediate Past Chair of the Faculty Senate, who shall be the Nominating Committee Chair;
			2. [The]{#VII.E.ii.b} Chair-Elect of the Faculty Senate;
			3. [three]{#VII.E.ii.c} members elected by the Executive Council from the Faculty Senate at large with a maximum of one who may be a member of the Executive Council.
		3. [The]{#VII.E.iii} Chair of the Nominating Committee shall present candidate slates to the full Faculty Senate at appropriate times but no later than the last regular meeting of the Faculty Senate in the Spring. Additional nominations for each position may be made from the floor of the Faculty Senate. Voting shall occur at this meeting or immediately thereafter using electronic format.
		4. [Every]{#VII.E.iv} elected member of the Faculty Senate is eligible for election either as Chair-Elect of the Faculty Senate or as a member of the Executive Council for a term of three years with one exception: the Faculty Senate may not be chaired by the representative of any one School for more than three consecutive years.
		5. [The]{#VII.E.v} Faculty Representative to the Board of Visitors will be elected annually for a term of one year.  Nominations will be made in December.

			A Faculty Representative and two alternates will be presented to the Board of Visitors based on an election to be completed by February 15. For the election, the nominating committee will solicit candidates. The current chair will automatically be included as a candidate in the election, if they are willing to serve. If the chair is willing to serve, the minimum number of additional candidates for the election is two. If the chair cannot serve, the nominating committee must solicit at least three nominations. Nominees may be chosen from current members of the Faculty Senate or from the body of faculty eligible to serve on the Faculty Senate.

			Senators will vote for their preferred candidates by rank choice indicating preferences in sequence (e.g., first, second, third, etc.). They do not need to rank every candidate. The individual who receives the most first-choice votes will be presented to the BOV as the Faculty Representative, assuming they were ranked first by at least 50% of the voting senators. If there is no majority candidate, the Faculty Representative will be determined by taking the second choice vote of every senator who did not vote for one of the top two candidates as their first choice and adding that to the tally. The Faculty Representative must be ranked by a majority of voting senators.

			Of the remaining candidates, the two candidates who received the highest number of first- and second-choice votes will be presented as the two alternates, assuming they were ranked by a majority of voting senators. If only two candidates were ranked by a majority of voting senators, the Faculty Senate will initially present a representative and one alternate. The remaining seat will be filled by a runoff using traditional single-choice voting, and the winner of that election will be the second alternate. For the runoff, all remaining candidates will be on the ballot and additional candidates may be nominated.

8. **[Meetings of the Faculty Senate]{#VIII}**

	1. [Meetings]{#VIII.A} of the Faculty Senate are open to the public.
	2. [Notice]{#VIII.B} of meetings of the Faculty Senate shall be sent to all members at least one week in advance of the date of the meeting.
	3. [The]{#VIII.C} agenda for each meeting, and supporting papers, shall be distributed with the call for the meeting. Items not included in the agenda may be brought before the meeting for acting only by a vote of three-fourths of the members of the Faculty Senate present at the meeting.
	4. [Resolutions]{#VIII.D} presented to the Faculty Senate for action shall normally have received prior consideration by the appropriate committee, and the Executive Council shall be responsible for ensuring that this has been done.
	5. [In]{#VIII.E} the event of an emergency, rules governing the advance call for a meeting may be waived by the President or the Executive Council. A meeting so called shall not begin until a quorum is present. The first item of business must be to determine whether, in the judgment of those present, an emergency does in fact exist. Unless this is affirmed by a three-fourths vote of those present, the meeting shall automatically stand adjourned.
	6. [Quorum]{#VIII.F} definitions:

		A quorum shall consist of 40 per cent of the voting members of the Faculty Senate or 30 per cent of the members of a Faculty Senate committee whose names appear currently on the Faculty Senate roster. In determining a quorum, only voting members physically or electronically present shall be counted. Votes cast at a meeting are valid if a quorum is present.

	7. [Voting]{#VIII.G} by proxy shall be accepted for meetings. If a Senator is unable to be present for a vote included in the agenda, a written proxy designating the name of the assigned Faculty Senator, type of proxy (general or special), date of the vote, and (if necessary) topic of the vote shall be sent electronically to both the Chair of the Faculty Senate and the assigned current Senator who will be present for the discussion that will accompany the voting process. A proxy may be general or special at the discretion of the senator giving the proxy power to another senator; “a general proxy authorizes the person to whom it is entrusted to exercise general discretion throughout the matter in hand, while a special proxy limits the authority to some special proposal or resolution.” Proxies shall be appended to the attendance log for the meeting. Votes by special proxy shall be valid only for previously announced, written motions, that are included in the agenda and come to vote without amendment, or are amended such that, in the sole discretion of the parliamentarian, the amendment is deemed not to significantly alter the substance of the motion, but is instead technical, clarifying, or otherwise minor in its effect. The parliamentarian may render an opinion on whether an amendment to a motion is significant prior to the Faculty Senate voting to accept the motion.

	8. [Robert's]{#VIII.H} Rules of Order, revised, shall govern in all cases in which they are applicable and not in conflict with this Constitution and By-Laws.

	9. [Election]{#VIII.I} of a Parliamentarian who is a consultant advising on parliamentary procedure and the use of Roberts Rules, as well as offering procedural rulings, during meetings of the Faculty Senate and the Executive Council.

		1. [The]{#VIII.I.i} Parliamentarian is a non-Senator Parliamentarian who shall attend the prescribed meetings with neither voice nor vote.

9. **[Amendments]{#IX} to the Constitution and By-Laws of the Faculty Senate**

	1. [Changes]{#IX.A} in the Constitution and By-Laws of the Faculty Senate may be proposed at a regular meeting by any member of the Faculty Senate. To be approved, such changes must be the subject of notice provided to all Senators of the University of Virginia at least two weeks prior to the next meeting of the Faculty Senate. Faculty Senate members are encouraged to ascertain the wishes of their constituencies. Voting on amendments to the constitution and by-laws of the Faculty Senate shall be conducted online as soon as possible following the first meeting of the Faculty Senate occurring two or more weeks after notice of the proposed amendments if given, but such vote must occur within one week of such meeting. The vote shall be open for no less than 5 days. Adoption will require the affirmative vote of 60% of the members of the Faculty Senate.
